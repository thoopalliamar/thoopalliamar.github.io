      a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books. DiCaprio's
      father is of Italian (from Alife) and German (from Bavaria) descent. DiCaprio's maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken,
      was German. His maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken (born Yelena Smirnova; 1915–2008),was a Russian-born German
      citizen.In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and said that two of his grandparents
      were Russian.DiCaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California.

        DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum
        in Florence, Italy, when he first kicked. His parents separated when he was a year old, and he lived mostly with
        his mother. The two lived in several Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz (his Los Feliz residence
        was later converted into a public library), while his mother worked several jobs. DiCaprio attended Seeds Elementary
        School (now UCLA Lab School) and John Marshall High School a few blocks away, after attending the Los Angeles Center
        for Enriched Studies for four years. He dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his
        general equivalency diploma (GED). DiCaprio spent part of his childhood in Germany with his maternal grandparents,
        Wilhelm and Helene. He is conversant in German and Italian.

        DiCaprio was also a contestant on the children's game show Fun House. One of the stunts he performed on the show was going
        fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.
